# Advantages of Formated Git Commit Message

* allow generating CHANGELOG.md by script
* allow ignoring commits by git bisect (not important commits like formatting)
* provide better information when browsing the history

## Allow generating CHANGELOG.md by script

We can use these three sections in changelog: **new features**, **bug fixes**, **breaking changes**.This list could be generated by script when doing a release. Along with links to related commits.Of course you can edit this change log before actual release, but it could generate the skeleton.

[example 1](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) / [example 2](https://github.com/btford/grunt-conventional-changelog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

```wiki
6.0.0 (2016-02-11)
Bug Fixes
    concat: make sure the encoding is always buffer (75fc4ee)
    error: attach handler to the stream (a54a194)

Chores
    deps: bump (0320cba)

BREAKING CHANGES
    deps: Using conventional-changelog v1.
```

List of all subjects (first lines in commit message) since last release:

```bash
git log <last tag> HEAD --pretty=format:%s
```

New features in this release

```bash
git log <last release> HEAD --grep feature
```

## Recognizing unimportant commits

These are formatting changes (adding/removing spaces/empty lines, indentation), missing semi colons, comments. So when you are looking for some change, you can ignore these commits - no logic change inside this commit.

When bisecting, you can ignore these by:

```bash
git bisect skip $(git rev-list --grep irrelevant <good place> HEAD)
```

## Provide more information when browsing the history

This would add kinda “context” information.
Look at these messages (taken from last few angular’s commits) by
git commmand `git log <last-tag> HEAD --pretty=format:%s`:

* Fix small typo in docs widget (tutorial instructions)
* Fix test for scenario.Application - should remove old iframe
* docs - various doc fixes
* docs - stripping extra new lines
* Replaced double line break with single when text is fetched from Google
* Added support for properties in documentation

All of these messages try to specify where is the change. But they don’t share any convention...

Look at these messages:

* fix comment stripping
* fixing broken links
* Bit of refactoring
* Check whether links do exist and throw exception
* Fix sitemap include (to work on case sensitive linux)

Are you able to guess what’s inside ? These messages miss place specification...
So maybe something like parts of the code: docs, docs-parser, compiler, scenario-runner, …

I know, you can find this information by checking which files had been changed, but that’s slow. And when looking in git history I can see all of us tries to specify the place, only missing the convention.

**but wait, how about**:

```wiki
$ git log fb2d3f --pretty=format:%s |head -4

docs(guide/Components): add link to documentation for component method
docs(angular.Module): improved documentation for component method
fix(input[date]): correctly parse 2-digit years
docs(guide/migration): add notes on 1.6 to 1.7 migration
```

## Allow ignoring commits by git bisect (not important commits like formatting)

List of all subjects (first lines in commit message) since last release:

`$ git log <last tag> HEAD --pretty=format:%s`

List of some kind of subjects since last release:

`$ git log <last tag> HEAD --pretty=format:%s --grep='^<TYPE>'`

```wiki
$ git log fb2d3f --grep='^fix' --pretty=format:%s

fix(input[date]): correctly parse 2-digit years
fix(input): allow overriding timezone for date input types
fix(input): take timezone into account when validating minimum and maximum date types
fix(jqLite): make removeData() not remove event handlers
```

New features in this release:

`$ git log <last relase> HEAD --grep=feture`

```wiki
$ git log --grep=feture

    fix($route): fix redirection with optional/eager params

    Previously, when (automatically) redirecting from path that fetured a
    trailing slash and optional or "eager" parameters, the resulting path
    would (incorrectly) contain the special characters (`?`,`*`) along with
    the parameter values.

    Closes #9819

    Closes #9827
